Quick Start Lessons
-------------------

The Speedioc Quick Start Lessons are a set of integration tests that serve a 
dual purpose: to test features of Speedioc and to provide a set of incremental 
lessons that show how Speedioc is used.

The tests and their supporting code are fully documented with code comments 
that explain the details of Speedioc's APIs in order of increasing complexity.

The tests that comprise these Quick Start Lessons are integrations tests and 
follow the same usage patterns as would be used in a typical application. 
They are not unit tests that run in isolation but do serve as tests that 
validate the expected functionality of Speedioc.
