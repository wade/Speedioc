MSBuild.NUnit.README.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The build currently depends on MSBuild.NUnit.dll.
This is currently included as a binary stored in VCS.
This is not optimal. The project for this dependency does not 
currently have a working NuGet package. I will likely create a 
NuGet package for this sometime soon.

MSBulid.NUnit.dll is a build of the MSBuild.NUnit project created 
by monoman and can be found here:
